# Algorithms, 4th Edition

## Chapter 1 Notes

This is notepad for the first chapter in the book. Any background details that 
aren't covered in the code itself should be found in here.

* Algorithms go hand-in-hand with data structures.
* Abstract Data Types (ADTs) specify an API for data structures.

### 1.1 Basic Programming Model

1.1.1 a) 7.5
1.1.1 b) 200.0000002
1.1.1 c) true

1.1.2 a) 1.618, float.
1.1.2 b) 10.0, float.
1.1.2 c) True, boolean.
1.1.2 d) '33', string

1.1.3 See example code
1.1.5 See example code
1.1.6 0, 1, 0, etc

1.1.11 See example code

### 1.2 Data Abstraction

* Classes are different to static modules in Python:
    * Classes have a constructor, using same name as class with no return values
    * Some instance methods are present to adhere to Python's conventions, for
      example toString() is the same as __str__(self):

* Objects are characterized by 3 properties
    * State: value from its data type
    * Identity: Distinguishes one object from another
    * Behaviour: Effect of data-type operations

### 1.3 Bags, Queues, and Stacks

* Aims of the section
    * Design ADTs for Bags, Queues, and Stacks. These are collections.
    * Introduce generics (not relevant in Python) and iteration
    * Show importance of linked data structures (e.g. linked lists)
    * 

### 1.4 Analysis of Algorithms

### 1.5 Case Study: Union Find

* Initially all sites are stored in a component with the same ID.
